# DeepDiverCueRates

This repository contains material for the manuscript "A sperm whale cautionary tale about estimating acoustic cue rates for deep divers" by Tiago A. Marques, Carolina S. Marques and Kalliopi C. Gkikopoulou submitted to The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America. The paper is currently under revisions following a first set of comments at JASA.

In the main folder there is a dynamic report, as well as the data, which allows to reproduce all the statistics and recreate the figures in the manuscript.

Additionally, in the sub-folder "click_extraction_matlab" the bespoke MATLAB functions created by MArk Johnson which could be used to reprocess the DTAG sound files to extract the sperm whale clicks are also shared. 

We note however the raw saound files are not shared, as these are owned by the researchers that tagged the whales, to whome we thank sharing their data for the purposes of this paper.
