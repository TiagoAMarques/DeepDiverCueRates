For easy access when reading the JASA paper by Marques et al. 2023 A sperm whale cautionary tale about estimating acoustic cue rates for deep divers 
this repository included a copy of the functions (findclicks, findallclicks and findmissedclicks) used to perform the click extraction process. 

The tools required for DTAG processing can be downloaded from https://soundtags.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/dtags/

There might be a new site in the future to host all functions and we recommend a google search for "soundtags" to check if it exists.

Another site where tools to work with DTAGs are available is https://animaltags.org/

All tools and matlab functions have been created by Dr Mark Johnson, and we are sharing those here with his permission.
