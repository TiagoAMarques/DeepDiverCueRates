Here is a copy of the functions (findclicks, findallclicks and findmissedclicks) used to perform the click extraction process. 
The tools required for DTAG processing can be downloaded from https://soundtags.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/dtags/.
There might be a new site in the future to host all functions and we recommend a google search for "soundtags" to check if it exists.
All tools and matlab functions have been created by Dr Mark Johnson.
